## Trading Setup

### Trading Systems (patterns)

- Pin Bar (Kangaroo Tail)

### Anatomy of VALID Pin Bar:
- The wick should be at least 2-3 times the length of the body
- The body should be completely within previous bars range
- The body should be present towards either the upper or lower extreme of the Pin Bar
- The wick should stand out when compared to previous bars (with room to the left)
- Pin Bar will affect immediately following 4-5 bars

### Identify Market Trend: 

Switch to LINE CHART instead of candlestick to draw Support & Resistance Zone
To Gauge strength and direction of a trend, when a trend have exhausted itself and is about to turn the other way.
We rely on a combination of:

- Trend Lines
- Moving Averages
- Support/Resistance Zone
- Large Round Numbers


IF Price > 200EMA THEN UPTREND.
IF Price < 200EMA THEN DOWNTREND

The BEST Pin Bar to trade  form during retracement at those areas of interest after a sustained move.

- Ideally a Pin Bar should close in the direction of the prevailing trend:
 * IF UPTREND then BULLISH Pin Bar closes higher than than the open.
 * IF DOWNTREND then BEARISH Pin Bar closes lower than the open.
 
### CONTINUATION PATTERN: 
If the wick of the Pin Bar is more than 4 times larger than the average trading range of the previous bars.
Always trade with the trend.

## Indicators Used for Confluence ONLY
MA - used to gauge the direction and strength of the trend - They are dynamic SR Levels. price religiously bounces off certain EMAs during retraces.

- SMA(8)
- EMA(21, 50, 200) - reacts more quickly to recent price events than SMA
- Fibonacci Retracement: 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the most important levels for Pin Bar. Trade it in confluence with MA and EMA.
- Pivot Points

CONFLUENCE Examples: 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + Fib 50% Level + Pin Bar 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + S&R level + Bullish Pin Bar
- UpTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + Pullback to Pivot + Fibo 78.6% Level + Pin Bar


## Timeframes

- 4H
- D1

## Entry Signal (On PULLBACK ONLY - WAIT FOR IT !!!!)

- External conditions to consider (market or news events):
  * check https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar  - if any RED flag (imapcting news) about the pair - DO NOT TRADE
  
- Conditions to enter (REASONS NOT to TRADE): 
   * Pin Bar at previous support/resistance level. Enter on open of next bar after current pin bar
   * Check daily, weekly, monthly drawdown => lot size calculation (generate SL, TP1,TP2 and TP3)
   * Risk 2% per trade
   * Minimum Risk/Reward ration 3:1

- Order1: Place BUY/SELL STOP ORDER a small distance (2-3 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (knowing that the price has moved in the direction of profit before placing the trade).
- Order2: Place SELL/BUY STOP ORDER a small distance (5 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (in case of reversal)

- Delete order that is not triggered after price movement (Immediately)

## Stop Loss
Place a stop to cover your bases in case my predictions about where the price will go is completely wrong.  

5 pips below/above Pin Bar - Risk 2% per trade

- Once the trade moves 2 or more pips in my favour bring my STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN

## Position Size (Trade Size !!!!) - 

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

- Account Risk (Account risk limit per trade): 10% weekly,  

- Trade Risk: 2% per trade (Max 6 Daily trades). - Pips at risk on each trade:difference between ENTRY and STOP LOSS

SL is 30 pips

$ at risk = Pips at risk X Pips Value X Lots traded.     => Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

Example: 
- Account size : $1k  ( account in USD)
- Pips at risk on trade: $30(3%)   
- Pips value = 25 pips SL 
Pair: EURUSD

Lot traded = $30/(25 x $1) = 1.2   => Take:
- 1 trade with lot 1.2 
- 3 trades with 0.4 lot size each

## Take Profit
The most important thing to do as a trader.
Not every trade is a winner. 
- 1. TP at nearest support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk)
- 2. TP at previous bars LOW or HIGH (Medium Risk, risk reward ration: 1:1.5)
- 3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 

Partial Profit:
- 50% at TP1
- 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)

Trailing STOP LOSS
Lock in profit to leave trade unattended.


## Exit Signal

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
- 3-Bar Exit
- Trailing Stop Loss (stop loss to breakeven)
